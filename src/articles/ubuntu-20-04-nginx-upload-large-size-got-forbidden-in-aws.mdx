If you encounter a "forbidden" error when trying to upload a large file, it's likely due to security measures.

## Solution

To fix it, do these two things:

## 1. Increase Upload Limit:

Adjust your server settings (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to allow larger file uploads.

## 2. Check WAF (Web Application Firewall):

Make sure your Web Application Firewall isn't blocking legitimate uploads. If needed, contact support to adjust the settings.

By following these simple steps, you can get rid of the "forbidden" error and allow large file uploads on your website.
